```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The goal is to replicate tables from an exisiting Urban paper. The paper I will use is titled:

# The Efficiency of Race-Neutral Alternatives to Race-Based Affirmative Action: Evidence from Chicago's Exam Schools
By: Glenn Ellison & Parag A. Pathak
```{r}
sample_data <- read.csv("/Users/pawonee/Desktop/PhD/Sem3/Urban/School/public_use_data/raw/tiers/tabula-tier2009_1.csv")
